# Word_Counter
 This is part of the requirements of the project for the module Secure Network Services (CS2SNS). Part of the requirements was to make a program utilising TCP/IP as the underlying communication mechanism and to have at least a Client and a server that consisted of at least two unique messages, so this is why this project came to be.

 # What is it
 This is a secure distributed program created with TCP/IP protocols and also utilises SSL and TLS to create a multi-threaded server where a client can ask the server a message and the server will respond with the word count of that message.

 # Setup
1) Install the contents of the repository.
2) There should be a folder with the following contents

</p>

3) Run the WordCounterServer program
4) Any other device can run the WordCounterClient program send messages to the server and expect a response
5) Expected results:

# Plans
There are no plans to expand on this project at the moment, but maybe in future there is the possibility that I may come back to it and add to it
